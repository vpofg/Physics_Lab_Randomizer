## Ohm Randomizer

We have forgot to read the values form the ohmmeter so we decided to fake them. The values are in range of tolerance of any resistor.

### Usage
To use, simply run the program in IDE and when asked, input the value of resistor in any unit, and then the percentage value of the resistors tolerance. You can also specify how many values you want generated.
